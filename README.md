## Project MoreThanHey (Server)

**MoreThanHey** is an activity-based matchmaking mobile web app with the feature-twist that you are not swiping other people, but fun free-time activities. For this you have to set up a profile (with username, password and other attributes e.g. age, gender and so on). After setting up your profile, you can choose from a selection of basic interests in activities (like food, culture, sport etc.) and based on this selection, you will be proposed activities, where you can swipe right for approval or left for rejecting the activity. Based on these decisions, you get a potential match list with other persons preferring the same activities and matching with the other criterias (age, gender, location). When both persons of such a match are online, they can go through a step-by-step real-time selection, where they can each vote on the concrete activity, on a time and choose the location to meet. After successfully completing these steps and coming to an agreement the event gets added to a list for the user to keep track of upcoming activities.
